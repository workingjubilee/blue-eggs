# Blue Eggs for Stardew Valley

This mod adds blue eggs to Stardew Valley.
* They're blue.
* They are only laid by blue chickens, and blue chickens only lay blue eggs.
* They work identically to white or brown Eegs. That means...
* They do not always hatch into blue chickens, but randomly (like white or brown Eggs after blue chickens are unlocked).
* There is no blue mayonnaise (bluennaise?).

Its sole dependency is on [SMAPI](https://smapi.io). It does not require JsonAssets or other mods to work.

# Install Process

...And it doesn't actually work yet! Will let you know when it does.
Should be a simple matter of just dropping the files into the mod folder.
